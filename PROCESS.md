## Architecture
I used a component-based React architecture where each section (Hero, TechStack, Projects, Publications, Footer) is separated into individual components. This improves scalability, readability, and maintainability.

## AI Usage
Prompt Used:
"Generate a responsive React portfolio SPA with Hero, TechStack, Projects, and Footer using functional components and CSS grid."

AI was used to accelerate layout creation and code structure. Final optimization and responsiveness were manually verified.

## Challenges
as of now i did not find any such challenges
